Words go here. Allied resources You can find additional resources for students and instructors here Contributing An advantage of an Open Educational Resource compared to traditional publishing (besides it being free!) is that it is a live, ongoing project, for as long as anyone cares to keep it alive. If you are using this resource, I would encourage you to contribute to help me improve it, by: suggesting improvements to the text, e.g. clarifying unclear sentences, fixing typos (see guidance from Yihui Xie); proposing changes to the code, e.g. to do things in a more efficient way. Doing this is as easy as editing a wiki page; use the Edit button in the toolbar to make a pull request (you need to have a GitHub account and be able to fork the repository): In addition, please feel free to make requests for features or to develop content (see the project’s issue tracker). 0.0.1 License This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
