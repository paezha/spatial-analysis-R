NOTE: echo=is_html does not work

Inspired by [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial ([FOSS4G](http://foss4g.org/)) movement, this book is open source.
This ensures its contents are reproducible and publicly accessible for people worldwide.
The online version of the book is hosted at [geocompr.robinlovelace.net](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net) and kept up-to-date by [GitHub 
  Actions](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/actions), which provides information on its 'build status' as follows:

## What is this book and who is it for? {-}

Words go here.

## Allied resources {-}

You can find additional resources for students and instructors [here](https://github.com/paezha/spatial-analysis-r#resources-for-students-and-instructors)

## Contributing {-}

An advantage of an Open Educational Resource compared to traditional publishing (besides it being free!) is that it is a live, ongoing project, for as long as anyone cares to keep it alive. If you are using this resource, I would encourage you to contribute to help me improve it, by:

- suggesting improvements to the text, e.g. clarifying unclear sentences, fixing typos (see guidance from [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/2013/06/fix-typo-in-documentation/));
- proposing changes to the code, e.g. to do things in a more efficient way.

Doing this is as easy as editing a wiki page; use the `Edit` button in the toolbar to make a pull request (you need to have a GitHub account and be able to fork the repository):

[![EDIT ME](images/editme.png)](https://github.com/paezha/spatial-analysis-r/edit/main/index.Rmd)

In addition, please feel free to make requests for features or to develop content (see the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/paezha/spatial-analysis-r/issues)).
